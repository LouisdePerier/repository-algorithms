# Project Description
Our application is designed for university students and young professionals that want to change their mindset. We want to help people make the most out of their day, as we profoundly beleive that every day should be lived as the last one. Our app enables its users to organize their activities and the time involved, set goals and objectives as well as tracking their improvement. Overall, our main aim is to help students acheive higher productivity and reach their full potential. We used PyCharm and Google collab as we have seen these tools in class and we wanted to implement what we have learnt in our project. Some challenges we faced were the complexity of some algorithms we wanted to use but couldn't due to some lack of experience. Some features we would like to add in a near future are the possibility to share your goals with other users and implement some common objectives in order to bring together students and foster a sense of community. If various users can see each others improvements and weaknesses, they can support each other and motivate each other to manage their time better.  

# Prerequisites and Environment
This programm has been developed using Python in the integrated development environment Pycharm. To use our programm you will require to have an enviroment that works properly and that allows the use of GUI(graphical user interface). You will also require to have a version of pythonm higher than 3.4

For the proper functioning of the code the first thing you need to do is install the package of wxpython so the user interface can be displayed properly, do the following:
  - Donwload wxpython package:
To download the library type the following command in the terminal of the enviroment:  
    ```pip install wxPython ``` 
  
# INSTALLATION y USAGE

Now that we have the required components, Follow the next steps:

 1. Open the file named "app.py" stored in github and download the file and open it in your enviroment.
 2. Next run the program. It will redirect you to the user interface. Open it fully.
 3. Now that the interface is diplayed you can start using the taskscheduler.
 4. You can introduce the Task Description, Task Deadline Date , Task Deadline time adn its priority. Press the button "Add Task" to save the task, a message will be shown in the console of the interface confirming that the operation has been done properly. Once shown the message you can strat saving another task.
 5. Once you have saved the task you want. You can either use the "Get Next Task" to see in the console the next task you want to see or use the "List All Task" to print the tasks in calendar format in the console. 
 

# Some extra information
We have used the following data structures:

  1. Hash Tables - Used to store all task uploaded by the user. 
  2. Priority queues using Heaps - used to find the most appropriate order for the tasks.  

# Further improvements

To imporve our programme we would like to develope several features that will imporve the user experience such as:

1.Introduce a task deletion functionality(Allows users to mark tasks as done or to delete any task they want)
2.Task priority adjustment(enables user to change the priority of tasks)
3.Implement another attribute to the task's class which is "category"(this will allow to filter task depending on its category in case the user wants to only display certain relaited tasks)
4.Implement another attribute to the task's class which is "duration"(this will help to better fit in task and structure the calendar better.)
4.Improve GUI by making it more use friendly, including a log in and personalice better the use of the app.
5.Improve the display of the task, making it in calendar format. As well as intrpducing a feature that will allow you save the tasks in your own calendar outside the app.
