# Project's name - TIMEWISE
"TimeWise: Manage your time efficiently!"

# Project Description
Our application is designed for university students and young professionals that want to change their mindset. We want to help people make the most out of their day, as we profoundly beleive that every day should be lived as the last one. Our app enables its users to organize their activities and the time involved, set goals and objectives as well as tracking their improvement. Overall, our main aim is to help students acheive higher productivity and reach their full potential. We used PyCharm and Google collab as we have seen these tools in class and we wanted to implement what we have learnt in our project. Some challenges we faced were the complexity of some algorithms we wanted to use but couldn't due to some lack of experience. Some features we would like to add in a near future are the possibility to share your goals with other users and implement some common objectives in order to bring together students and foster a sense of community. If various users can see each others improvements and weaknesses, they can support each other and motivate each other to manage their time better.  

  
# INSTALLATION
To be able to run our program, make sure you have the following things installed:

  - Python programming language - It will work in all versions between 3.6 and 3.8. 
  - Modules - In order to run our program, we make use of the following 2 modules: heapq and datetime, they are built in modules so the user does not need to do any changes.
  - Donwload wxpython package:
To download the library type the following command   
    ```pip install wxPython ``` 
  
  Now that we have the required components, open the file named app.py and run the program. 

# USAGE 
Once the installation is completed. The user will be welcomed, and they will be received with the first question "Do you want to add a new task?" if the user wants to proceed to the addition of a task they should answer "yes". After this the program will allow them to add the following characteristics of the task:

1-Task description: Here the user will be able to insert the name of the corresponding task (they can also include a short description)

2-Deadline date: The program will ask for a date, (only month and day)

3-Deadline time: The user will have to introduce the time of the deadline the task has.(in hours)

4-Task priority: The user will have to choose the priority the task has (either 1, 2 or 3. 1 being the most important tasks)

After the user has completed the description of the task, the program will again ask if they want to add a new task, they will have to do the same process for the new task. Once the user has added all the task, they want the should answer "no" to the question of "Do you want to add a new task?", and the program will automatically print the corresponding task that have being saved, They will be printed in most efficient way to be carried out.  

# Some extra information
We have used the following data structures:

  1. Hash Tables - Used to store all task uploaded by the user. 
  2. Priority queues using Heaps - used to find the most appropriate order for the tasks.
