# Project's name - TIMEWISE
"TimeWise: Manage your time efficiently!"

# Project Description
Our application is designed for university students and young professionals that want to change their mindset. We want to help people make the most out of their day, as we profoundly beleive that every day should be lived as the last one. Our app enables its users to organize their activities and the time involved, set goals and objectives as well as tracking their improvement. Overall, our main aim is to help students acheive higher productivity and reach their full potential. We used PyCharm and Google collab as we have seen these tools in class and we wanted to implement what we have learnt in out projcet. Some challenes we faced where the complexity of some algorithms we wantes but couldn't due to some lack of experience. Some features we would like to add in a near future are the possibility to share your goals with other users and implement some common objectives in order to bring together students and foster a sense of community. If various users can see echa others improvemnets and weaknesses, they can support each other and motivate each other to manage their time better.  

  
# INSTALLATION
To be able to run our program, make sure you have the following things installed:

  - Python programming language - It will work in all versions between 3.6 and 3.8. 
  - Libraries - In order to run our program, we make use of the following 2 libraries: heapq_max and re  
        To download the library type the following command   
    ```pip install heapq_max ``` 
  
  Now that we have the required libraries set up, open the file named app.py and run the program. 


# How to use the project:

First of all, the program will ask the user how many tasks do you have. You enter the number and lets imagine that we have 3 tasks. For each one, the program will ask to enter a brief description (go to the gym, make the maths assignment...), the deadline (2023-11-25) and the priority it has (1 being the highest and 3 the lowest). Once you have answered all this, the program will return you the task order taking into account de duedate. In case that the duedate is the same as any other task, the priority level is what is going to set which one to do first.
